      <h2>Robotic Arm</h2>
      <p><a href="https://arctosrobotics.com/#Assembly">Robotic Arm</a></p>
      <p>This robotic arm has been a project that I was interested in ever since I was in my engineering and architecture class during my Junior year of high school. The project was in progress during my Senior year in my AP CS class. In order to construct the project, the pieces needed to be 3D printed and assembled using fasteners and hand tools. After the project was assembled, we used python to code the arm and to make a functional and successfully achieved robotic arm. </p>

      <p>The app created is used to create all types of shapes varying from the basics to more complex polynomials. The shape can be defined by inserting a number of sides in response to a question or typing a letter linked to a shape using your keyboard!</p>
