    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="img/zxcc2habizq51.jpg" alt="Benicia" />
      <p>Growing up in Benicia, many people I met were fortunately in my life for a while helping me through, like many, hardships, which helped me to be a better version of myself. Although there’s still room for improvement, as always, I’m grateful for the events in my life that helped me to positively change and progress through my younger years. </p>
